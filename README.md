# Ibis
A bash script that scrapes a hurricane's lattitude and longitude from NOAA's NHC and spawns a browser window with a twitter search in that area.

Named after the bird. According to legend, the ibis is the last sign of wildlife to take shelter before a hurricane hits and the first to reappear once the storm has passed.
